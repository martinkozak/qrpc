QRPC
====

**QRPC** currently implements queued JSON-RPC server which works as 
normal RPC server, but through queue interface, so allows highly 
scalable, distributed and asynchronous remote API implementation and 
fast data processing. 

It's based on [eventmachine][1] and [beanstalkd][2] so it's fast and 
thread safe. 

### Protocol

It utilizes [JSON-RPC][3] protocol in versions both [1.1][4] and [2.0][5].
Adds special data member `qrpc` with few options appropriate for queue 
processing. Typicall request looks in Ruby hash notation like:
    
    {
        "jsonrpc" => "2.0",
        "method" => "subtract",
        "params" => [2, 1],
        "id" => <some unique job id>,
        "qrpc" => {
            "version" => "1.0",
            "client" => <some unique client id>,
            "priority" => 30
        }
    }
    
The last `priority` member is optional, others are expected to be 
present including them which are optional in classic JSON-RPC. 
Default priority is 50.

Typical response looks like:

    {
        "jsonrpc" => "2.0",
        "result" => 1,
        "id" => <some unique job id>,
        "qrpc" => {
            "version" => "1.0",
        }
    }
    
And in case of exception:

    {
        "jsonrpc" => "2.0",
        "error" => {
            "code" => <some code>,
            "message" => <some message>,
            "data" => {
                "name" => <exception class name>,
                "message" => <exception message>,
                "backtrace" => <array of Base64 encoded strings>,
                "dump" => {
                    "raw" => <Base 54 encoded marshaled exception object>,
                    "format" => "Ruby"
                }
            }
        },
        
        "id" => <some unique job id>,
        "qrpc" => {
            "version" => "1.0",
        }
    }
    
Both `backtrace` and `dump` members are optional.

    
### Usage

Usage is simple. Look example:

    require "qrpc/server"
    
    class Foo
        def subtract(x, y)
            x - y
        end
    end

    server = QRPC::Server::new(Foo::new)
    server.listen! QRPC::Locator::new("test")
    
This creates an instance of `Foo` which will serve as API, creates
locator of the queue *test* at default server *localhost:11300*. Queue 
name will be remapped to the real name *qrpc-test-input*. After call to 
`#listen!`, it will run eventmachine and start listening for calls. If 
you want to run it inside already run eventmachine, simply call 
`#start_listening` with the same parameters.

Calls processing is thread safe because of eventmachine concept 
similar to fibers. Default number at one time processed jobs is 20,
but it can be changed by setting `:max_jobs => <number>` to `#listen!` 
or `#start_listening`.

Reponse will be put to the same queue server, to queue named 
`qrpc-<client identifier>-output`, with structure described above. 
Client isn't implemented at this time.
